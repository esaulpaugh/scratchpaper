Crypto Time Lock

Separate your wallet password from yourself in time through iterated hashing.

Instead of memorizing your wallet password, memorize your wallet password's seed:

password = HASH(HASH(...HASH(HASH(HASH(seed)))...))

or

password = HASH(HASH(...HASH(HASH(HMAC(random_salt, seed)))...))

Example:

Seed (i.e. master password) "Jeb!2064" might produce derived password "bdrvpUu8N8xN3s7xi22jM" after 80 billion iterations.

Delay is configurable via the number of iterations (for a given algorithm and hardware speed).

Potential implementations:

MD5, BLAKE2, or Keccak on FPGA or ASIC.
Argon2d on general-purpose hardware.

Device could retain the (optionally secret) salt and iteration settings.
